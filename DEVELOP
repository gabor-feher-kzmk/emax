	The Emax's philosophy
----------------------------------------
Emax is not a fast OS. It is created to handle many processes at one time.
It's the futures technology, because the multi processor machines are the 
futures computers. These are more powerfull than a xGHz CPU, if they have
the right OS running on them. Emax also wants to make high preformance
machine from PC-s connected with fast Ethernet. (Some kind of thin like Amoeba)

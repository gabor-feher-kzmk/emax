[1] System requirements
-------------------------------------    
The Emax version 0.01 doesn't support lots of kind of hardware. 
So you need :
  - i386 comatible machine (386,486,Pentium I/II/Celeron/III/4 ,K5,K6,K7/Duron)
  - 2 MB RAM (or higher, but only 64 MB is used)
  - 1.44 Floppy drive
  - Color Video Card
  - AT/PS/2 Keyboard
-------------------------------------    
[2] Installation under DOS/Win/NT
-------------------------------------
 Under DOS/Win/NT you can't recompile the kernel. You can use a
 pre-compiled kernel (k32.img) to run the system. You can also
 use the root floppy image (emaxfs.img).
    The easyest way to install this is running inst-dos.bat under
 one of these platforms. This script will ask you for two floppies
 One labeled boot and a nother labeled root.
    After you run the script put the boot floppy in drive and restart
 your machine. If the loader loaded the system, it'll ask for the root
 floppy. Yust put it in. After you pressed enter a message :
 "Press ENTER to activete console" will apear. Press Enter again, 
 and the the system is now running.

    [3] Installation under Linux
-------------------------------------    
 Under Linux or any kind of unix compatible system /FreeBSD,QNX,MINIX/
 you can compile the system if you have gcc 2.7.x (gcc 2.95.x is not 
 supported yet). You can modify some features of the system, in 
 ./emax/CONFIG/config.h . To compile the kernel, just run Make.sh in
 the emax directory. And now just run the inst-linux.sh script to do
 the rest.
    If you don't have gcc 2.7.x, just run the inst-linux.sh script and
 it will install a precompiled kernel on the floppies.
    After you run the script put the boot floppy in drive and restart
 your machine. If the loader loaded the system, it'll ask for the root
 floppy. Yust put it in. After you pressed enter a message :
 "Press ENTER to activete console" will apear. Press Enter again, 
 and the the system is now running.
